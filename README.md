### Task 1: Fix a critical bug

## Task instructions
Alright - let's find the bug in the Spinvoice system. Begin by downloading the invoice class.

To assist you in your search, we’ve provided a list of expectations for the system. It must fulfill the following requirements:

- An invoice tracks the name, address, and email of both its sender and recipient.
- An invoice tracks the date it was created, as well as items to charge for.
- An item may be added to an existing invoice.
- Each item has an associated name, price, and percent tax.
- The total price of an invoice is the sum of all its constituent items.
- A percent discount may be applied to the entire invoice.
- A discount must be applied before tax is determined.
- An invoice must calculate its total price based on all contained items.
 
Once you’ve had a moment to familiarize yourself with the code, start rooting around for the bug. # new-york-jobs-council-spinvoice
